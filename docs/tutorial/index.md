# Swift

!!! tip
    For a comprehensive tutorial with code that you can build and follow along with, see the
    [Tutorials](https://github.com/square/workflow-swift/tree/main/Samples/Tutorial) in
    the repo.

    This section will be restructured soon to incorporate that and Kotlin tutorials. In the
    meantime, check out [workflow-kotlin](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin/tree/main/samples)
    for Kotlin examples.

The Workflow infrastructure is split into several modules.

## `Workflow`

The `Workflow` library contains the core types that are used to implement state-driven workflows,
including the `Workflow` protocol and related infrastructure.

## `WorkflowUI`

Contains the basic infrastructure required to build a Workflow-based application that uses `UIKit`.

Workflow for iOS makes extensive use of [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift).
If you are new to reactive programming, you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the
basics. Workflow takes care of a lot of the reactive plumbing in a typical application, but you will
have a better time if you understand what the framework is doing.
